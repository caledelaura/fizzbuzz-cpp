# fizzbuzz-cpp
A repository of ways to fizzbuzz with C++.

Fizz buzz has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers. Creating a list of the first 100 Fizz buzz numbers is a trivial problem for any would-be computer programmer, so interviewers can easily sort out those with insufficient programming ability. FizzBuzz is also a popular Kata in the software craftsmanship movement. Computer programmers who call themselves "Software Craftsmen" will use exercises, often similar to this one, called 'Kata' repeatedly, often daily, in order to practice their craft, much like a soldier, a musician, a doctor or a dancer would repeat exercises or movements to practice theirs. 


The requirements are:

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples
> of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of
> five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and
> five print "FizzBuzz".

I'm looking For contributions to this project, to demonstrate various ways to fizzbuzz in this language. Please name new fizzbuzz files with fizzbuzz+"generaldescription".extention, and add a better description to the README.md below.


* [Fizzbuzz-ifs](https://github.com/coston/fizzbuzz-cpp/blob/master/Fizzbuzz-ifs.cpp) Basic fizzbuzz with bools and ifs.
* [Fizzbuzz-bruteforce](https://github.com/coston/fizzbuzz-cpp/blob/master/fizzbuzz-bruteforce.cpp) Brute forced fizzbuzz using puts, a halfhearted example.
* [Fizzbuzz-ifelseif](https://github.com/caledelaura/fizzbuzz-cpp/blob/master/Fizzbuzz-ifelse.cpp) Simple fizzbuzz using if else statements.
